YYAST
by Take Vos (2013)

YYAST is a library which completes Lex and Yacc by adding an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generator.
The saved AST is designed to be easily parsed by compilers.

You can find the documentation in doc/index.html.
The documentation is also online at: http://takev.github.io/yyast/doc/index.html
