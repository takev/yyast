                NEWS of released of the YASST library.
                ======================================


Version 1.0: BSD 2-Clause License

    Since I am hoping that YYAST will be used in as many as project as
    possible I have decided to release the YYAST library under a very
    permissive and compatible license. I have chosen the BSD 2-Clause
    License.



Version 0.2: Source file tracking

    In this version YYAST now tracks line numbers when in original source
    code. This is useful if someone would generate code for your language,
    and your compiler or debugger wants to show the original source code.

    For this change the on-disk format of the AST had to change significantly.
    I've tried to make it a lot more consistent and still easy to read. A
    header is now required to record the source filenames, but the header
    is build up with the same node structure as the rest of the file.



Version 0.1: Original release

    This is the first release of YYAST, a AST generator, a companion to
    Lex and Yacc.
